# OperatingPlatformsSDD
Software Design Document for Operating Platforms class



Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this design document was The Game Room, a game company with an Android app game. They currently have a game called "Draw It or Lose It" based on Andriod, and they want this transitioned to a web-based game that will operate on any platform.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I discussed the options for memory management particularly well within this design document, though most of the document is done well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having the design document was helpful when developing code as it gave a skeleton for me to base my code on, instead of going in blind when coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my recommendation for which operating platform to choose, and I would be more specific in which architecture to use for the client.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reading through their request thoroughly. It is important to consider the user's needs because it is their product that they will be paying for.
